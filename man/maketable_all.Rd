\section{Notes}{

The table that is produced is based upon 3 points for a win (unless otherwise
    defined), 1 for a draw and 0 for a loss.  The table is sorted based upon descending
    GD and then descending GF as tie-breakers. Use other 'maketable' functions for
    more precise tables for each league.
